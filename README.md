### 3. **Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?**

| **Aspect**          | **Agile**                                                                 | **Waterfall**                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**         | Iterative and incremental development                                     | Linear and sequential development                                             |
| **Flexibility**      | Highly adaptable to changes                                              | Less flexible; changes are costly after initial planning                     |
| **Documentation**    | Minimal upfront documentation                                             | Extensive documentation at each stage                                         |
| **Team Involvement** | Continuous collaboration with stakeholders                                | Limited stakeholder involvement until final stages                           |
| **Testing**          | Testing integrated throughout the process                                 | Testing occurs after development is complete                                 |

**Advantages of Agile:**
- Faster delivery of functional increments.
- Higher adaptability to changing requirements.

**Disadvantages of Agile:**
- Requires high team commitment and communication.
- Can lead to scope creep if not managed properly.

**Advantages of Waterfall:**
- Clear structure and defined phases.
- Suitable for projects with stable requirements.

**Disadvantages of Waterfall:**
- Lack of flexibility for changes.
- Late discovery of issues during testing.

### 4. **In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?**

**Agile Beneficial:**
- **Projects with Uncertain Requirements:** E.g., developing a new mobile app where user feedback drives design iterations.
- **Highly Collaborative Projects:** E.g., creating a custom CRM system with frequent client input.

**Waterfall Beneficial:**
- **Projects with Fixed Requirements:** E.g., building a bridge where specifications are well-defined.
- **Regulated Environments:** E.g., healthcare software requiring strict compliance and documentation.

---

### 5. **What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?**

**Methods for Quality Assurance:**
- **Automated Testing:** Implement unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests.
- **Code Reviews:** Conduct peer reviews to catch errors early.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automate build and deployment processes.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve end-users in testing before release.

**Importance of High Standards:**
- **Reduced Bugs:** Minimizes post-release issues, improving user experience.
- **Reputation Management:** Builds trust with clients and users.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Early detection of defects reduces repair costs.

### 6. **How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?**

**Defining Scope:**
- Provides clarity on deliverables, preventing scope creep.
- Aligns stakeholders' expectations with project goals.

**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**
- A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work into manageable components.
- **Usefulness:**
  - Facilitates better task allocation and resource planning.
  - Helps identify dependencies and critical paths.
